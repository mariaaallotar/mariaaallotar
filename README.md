# I'm Maria, a programming student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/)   

I have a unique combination of knowledge and competence as a result of a strong *academic base* in pedagogy and computer engineering, *hands-on experience* in coding and problem-solving gained during my current studies, and my interest in psychology and learning.

potential contribution to the company needs to be more concrete. Give examples
use a memorable anecdote or analogy in the cover letter that will ensure you stick in their memory
Less AI (threes, m-dashes)
“say who you are and what you’re good at. She said since they read a lot of them, the more direct you are the better. The meaning in flowery sentences tend to get lost”
“she said to talk about Hive and how and what we learn there. C/C++ . You can discuss the projects and peer to peer, self directed learning, team work ? Soft skills”
“Then if you have any personal projects related to the field you’re trying to get into then you can talk about it here. Whatever tech and methods you used”
“soft skills from previous experience. Whatever pedagogy related soft skills you think are more important”
